Hello, My name is Vedant Pahariya. I am a first year student and pursuing my B. Tech + MS by Research in field of "Electronics and Communication" from IIIT Hyderabad. 
Coding is also a integral part of our curriculum.
Iâ€™m interested in contributing some open source projects.
For that, Iâ€™m currently learning web development and DSA.
