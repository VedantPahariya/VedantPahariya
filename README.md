## ðŸ‘‹Hello, I'm Vedant Pahariya  

I am a third-year B.Tech + MS by Research student in Electronics and Communication at IIIT Hyderabad. 

## Current Work
I am currently working in the domain of Computer Systems Architecture, exploring:  
- RISC-V based processors
- Vector accelerators (Ara + CVA6)
- Multicore SoC design and benchmarking
- Chipyard & other RISC-V SoC frameworks
 
Currently, I am experimenting with multicore setups for performance analysis and actively looking for opportunities to contribute to open source projects in these domains.
